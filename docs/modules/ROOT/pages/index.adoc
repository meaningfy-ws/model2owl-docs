The https://github.com/OP-TED/model2owl/[*model2owl*] software project was conceived as part of the https://docs.ted.europa.eu/EPO/latest/business.html[eProcurement Ontology (ePO)] public procurement digitization project of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publications_Office_of_the_European_Union[Publications Office of the European Union (OP)]. It comprises a _toolset_, or set of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_tool[programming tools], for transforming an UML (v2.5) model from its XMI (v2.5.1) serialisation into a formal OWL ontology, and a SHACL shape. This approach is conformant to the https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/index.html[SEMIC Style Guide] and with https://github.com/OP-TED/model2owl/blob/master/docs/ontology-architecture/ontology-architecture.pdf[eProcurement Ontology Architecture specification].

The UML transformation is performed using XSLT stylesheets under the assumption that the UML model conforms to the set of conventions outlined in xref:uml/conceptual-model-conventions.adoc[ePO UML conventions]. This set of UML conventions is aligned with and extends the UML conventions specified in https://semiceu.github.io/style-guide/1.0.0/index.html[SEMIC Style Guide]. Validation rules for the transformation confirm the conformance to these conventions.

The following capabilities are implemented:

* UML -> Compliance report (ideal for checking the model against the established conventions)
* UML -> Glossary (ideal for a quick overview of terminology defined)
* UML -> OWL 2 (lightweight ontology suitable as a core vocabulary)
* UML -> OWL 2 (heavyweight ontology with additional axioms suitable for reasoning purposes)
* UML -> SHACL (data shapes suitable for representing an application profile)

This documentation is evolving and aims at covering the following aspects related to use of these tools:

* The architectural setup of the toolset and the ontology
* The conceptual model conventions that the UML model should adhere to, in order to enable the tools to generate the best possible results.
* The transformation rules applied in the process of conversion.
* The set of validation rules that check a transformation's conformance to the established conventions (and UML interpretations).

The tools can be used on any other ontology that is built according to the provided https://github.com/OP-TED/model2owl/blob/master/docs/ontology-architecture/ontology-architecture.pdf[modelling architecture] and xref:uml/conceptual-model-conventions.adoc[UML conceptual model conventions].
