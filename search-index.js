document provides a working specification of the guidelines and conventions for the eProcurement conceptual model, such that it qualifies as suitable input for the transformation scripts meant to generate the formal eProcurement ontology. The business context and the project overview are detailed in [costetchi2020a], while the next section provides the motivation and situates the current document within the project. In the eProcurement ontology project, the conceptual model was decided [d2.01-2017] to be represented in Unified Modelling Language (UML) [uml-userguide]. It is a visual representation language that facilitates understanding and convergence between stakeholders towards a common conceptualisation of the model. Generally, the primary application of UML [fowler2004] for ontology design is in the specification of class diagrams initially conceived for object-oriented software. UML does not define a formal semantics that would permit to determine, from the class diagrams, whether an ontology is consistent, or to determine the correctness of the ontology implementation. Semantics in such cases becomes a subject to interpretation by the stakeholders involved in the development process and later by the users in the application and integration tasks [grunninger2003]. On the other hand, UML is closer than more logic-oriented approaches to the programming languages in which enterprise applications are implemented. For this reason the current specification establishes conventions for interpretation of the UML-based conceptual model. The UML Conceptual Model of the eProcurement domain serves as the single source of truth, which means that the formal eProcurement ontology is derived from it through a model transformation process. It is possible to generate automatically the formal ontology in RDF format [rdf11] from the XMI (v.2.5.1) serialisation [xmi2.5.1] of a UML (v.2.5) model [uml2.5], provided that a set of clear transformation rules are established [costetchi2020c], and that a set of modelling conventions is respected. This document provides the UML modelling constraints and a set of conventional and technical recommendations for naming and structuring the UML class diagram elements: packages, classes, data types, enumerations, enumeration items, class attributes, association relation and dependency relation. There are additional elements which will be addressed contextually in the following sections. The eProcurement conceptual model must fulfil mainly four fundamental objectives. Facilitate understanding/comprehension of the represented system Promote efficient conveyance of system details between team members and external stakeholders. Provide a point of reference for system designers to gather system specifications and documentation. Serve as input for development of a (more) formal model. In order to support objectives a conceptual model should fulfil the following requirements. Be available to all team members, to facilitate collaboration and iteration. Be easily changeable, as a continuous reflection of up-to-date information. Contain both visual and written forms of diagramming, to better explain the abstract concepts it may represent. Establish relevant terms and concepts that will be used throughout the project. Define said terms and concepts. Provide a basic structure for entities of the project. Reduce the ambiguity while maintaining a simple and concise encoding.","title":"","component":"ROOT","version":"public-review","name":"epo-context","url":"/public-review/epo-context.html","titles":[{"text":"model2owl in eProcurement context","hash":"sec:introduction","id":1},{"text":"Background","hash":"_background","id":2},{"text":"Requirements","hash":"sec:requirements","id":3}]},"2":{"id":2,"text":"The model2owl GitHub project comprises a set of tools for transforming a UML (v2.5) model from its XMI (v2.5.1) serialisation into the formal ontology and associated SHACL data shapes.

Table 1 provides an overview of the section coverage. Table 1. Overview of transformation rules for UML classes and attributes UML element Rules in core ontology layer Rules in data shape layer Rules in reasoning layer Class Rule C.01 Rule C.02 Abstract class Rule C.03 Attribute Rule C.04 Rule C.06 Rule C.05 Attribute type Rule C.08 Rule C.07 Attribute multiplicity Rule C.11 Rule C.09, Rule C.10 In UML, a Class is purposed to specify a classification of objects. UML represents atomic classes as named elements of type Class without further features. In OWL, the atomic class, owl:Class, has no intention. It can only be interpreted by its name that has a meaning in the world outside the ontology. The atomic class is a class description that is simultaneously a class axiom . Figure 1. Visual representation of a class in UML (on the left) and OWL (on the right) Rule C.01. Class — in core ontology layer Specify an OWL Class declaration axiom for each UML Class, where the URI of the OWL class is deterministically generated from the UML Class name. Ideally, in the implementation, this rule would be combined with the relevant rules (those for the core ontology layer) in the Transformation of UML descriptors section, to provide labels and documentation for the class at the time of its creation. Listing 1. Class declaration in Turtle syntax :ClassName a owl:Class . Listing 2. Class declaration in RDF/XML syntax Rule C.02. Class — in data shape layer Specify a SHACL NodeShape declaration axiom for each UML Class. The URIs of the node shape and of the OWL class they refer to, are deterministically generated from the UML Class name. Ideally, in the implementation, this rule would be combined with the relevant rules (those for the data shape layer) in the Transformation of UML descriptors section, to provide labels and documentation for the node shape at the time of its creation. Listing 3. Node shape declaration in Turtle syntax @prefix : . @prefix shape: . @prefix sh: . shape:ClassName a sh:NodeShape ; sh:targetClass :ClassName ; . Listing 4. Node shape declaration in RDF/XML syntax In UML, an abstract Class cannot have any instances and only its subclasses can be instantiated. The abstract classes are declared just like the regular ones (Rule C.01 and Rule C.02) and in addition a constraint validation rule is generated to ensure that no instance of this class is permitted. OWL follows the Open World Assumption , therefore, even if the ontology does not contain any instances for a specific class, it is unknown whether the class has any instances. We cannot confirm that the UML abstract class is correctly defined with respect to the OWL domain ontology, but we can detect if it is not using SHACL constraints. Figure 2. Visual representation of an abstract class in UML (on the left) and OWL (on the right) Rule C.03. Abstract class — in data shape layer Specify a SHACL NodeShape declaration axiom for each abstract UML Class, with a SPARQL constraint that selects all instances of this class. Ideally, in the implementation, this rule would be combined with the relevant rules (those for the data shape layer) in the Transformation of UML descriptors section, to provide labels and documentation for the node shape at the time of its creation. Listing 5. Instance checking constraint in Turtle syntax @prefix : . @prefix shape: . @prefix sh: . shape:ClassName a sh:NodeShape ; sh:targetClass :ClassName ; sh:sparql [ sh:select \"\"\"SELECT $this WHERE { $this a :ClassName . } \"\"\" ; ] ; . Listing 6. Instance checking constraint in RDF/XML syntax SELECT $this WHERE { $this a :ClassName . } The UML attributes are properties that are owned by a Classifier, e.g. Class. Both UML attributes and associations are represented by one meta-model element – Property. OWL also allows one to define properties. A transformation of UML attribute to OWL data property or OWL object property is done based on its type. If the type of the attribute is a primitive type it should be transformed into OWL data property. However, if the type of the attribute is a structured datatype, class or enumeration, it should be transformed into an OWL object property. These cases are illustrated in Figure 3. Figure 3. Visual representation of class attributes in UML (on the left) and OWL properties (on the right) Attributes can also be reused across multiple classes (i.e. multiple UML classes can own the same attributes), as illustrated in Figure 4. In such cases there should be special logic applied when defining the domain and range of these properties (see rules Rule C.05, Rule C.07). Figure 4. Visual representation of reused class attributes in UML (on the left) and OWL properties (on the right) Rule C.04. Attribute — in core ontology layer Specify declaration axiom(s) for attribute(s) of a UML Class as OWL data or object properties, deciding based on their types. The attributes with primary types should be treated as data properties, whereas those typed with classes or enumerations should be treated as object properties. Ideally, in the implementation, this rule would be combined with the relevant rules (those for the core ontology layer) in the Transformation of UML descriptors section, to provide labels and documentation for the property at the time of its creation. Listing 7. Data property declaration in Turtle syntax :attribute1 a owl:DatatypeProperty ; . Listing 8. Data property declaration in RDF/XML syntax Listing 9. Object property declaration in Turtle syntax :attribute2 a owl:ObjectProperty . Listing 10. Object property declaration in RDF/XML syntax Rule C.05. Attribute domain — in reasoning layer Specify data (or object) property domains for attribute(s). The domain of properties created for attributes that are reused in multiple classes should be the union of all the classes where the attribute is reused. Listing 11. Data property domain specification in Turtle syntax :attribute1 rdfs:domain :ClassName ; . Listing 12. Data property domain specification in RDF/XML syntax Listing 13. Object property domain specification in Turtle syntax :attribute2 rdfs:domain :ClassName ; . Listing 14. Object property domain specification in RDF/XML syntax For reused attributes, like the ones depicted in Figure 4, the generated output should have the following form. Listing 15. Data property domain specification for reused attributes in Turtle syntax :attribute1 rdfs:domain [ rdf:type owl:Class ; owl:unionOf ( :ClassName1 :ClassName2 ) ] . Listing 16.

Listing 20. PropertyShape declaration for attributes in RDF/XML syntax Rule C.07. Attribute type — in reasoning layer Specify data (or object) property range for attribute(s). The range of object properties created for attributes that are reused in multiple classes should be the union of all the classes specified as values for those attributes. Listing 21.

Object property range specification for reused attributes in RDF/XML syntax Rule C.08. Attribute type — in data shape layer Within the SHACL PropertyShape corresponding to an attribute of a UML Class, specify property constraints indicating the range class or datatype. Listing 27.

Listing 30. Property class constraint in RDF/XML syntax In , multiplicity bounds of multiplicity element are specified in the form of [ .. ]. The lower-bound, also referred here as minimum cardinality or min is of a non-negative Integer type and the upper-bound, also referred here as maximum cardinality or max, is of an UnlimitedNatural type (see Section Primitive datatype). The strictly compliant specification of UML in version 2.5 defines only a single value range for MultiplicityElement. not limit oneself to a single interval. Therefore, the below UML to OWL mapping covers a wider case – a possibility of specifying more value ranges for a multiplicity element. Nevertheless, if the reader would like to strictly follow the current UML specification, the particular single lower..upper bound interval is therein also comprised. Figure 5. Visual representation of class attributes with multiplicity in UML (on the left) and OWL class specialising an anonymous restriction of properties (on the right) It should be noted that upper-bound of UML MultiplicityElement can be specified as unlimited: ``*''. In OWL, cardinality expressions serve to restrict the number of individuals that are connected by an object property expression to a given number of instances of a specified class expression . Therefore, UML unlimited upper-bound does not add any information to OWL ontology, hence it is not transformed. Rule C.09. Attribute multiplicity — in reasoning layer For each attribute multiplicity of the form ( min .. max ), where min and max are different than ``*'' (any), specify a subclass axiom where the OWL class, corresponding to the UML Class, specialises an anonymous restriction of properties formulated according to the following cases. exact cardinality, e.g. [2..2] minimum cardinality only, e.g. [1..*] maximum cardinality only, e.g. [*..2] maximum and maximum cardinality , e.g. [1..2] Listing 31.

Listing 38. Min and max cardinality constraint in RDF/XML syntax 1 2 Attributes with multiplicity exactly one correspond to functional object or data properties in OWL. If we apply the previous rule specifying min and max cardinality will lead to inconsistent ontology. To avoid that it is important that min and max cardinality are not generated from [1..1] multiplicity but only functional property axiom. Rule C.10. Attribute multiplicity \"one\" — in reasoning layer For each attribute that has multiplicity exactly one, i.e. [1..1], specify a functional property axiom. Listing 39.

Please note that in accordance with specification , the association end names are not obligatory. However, we adhere to the UML conventions , where specification of at one member ends, for unidirectional association, and two member ends, for bidirectional association, is mandatory. Moreover, provision of a connector (general) name is discouraged. Figure 1.

Min cardinality constraint in RDF/XML syntax 1 In case of recursive associations, that are from one class to itself, (depicted in Figure 2), the transformation rules must be applied as in the case of regular unidirectional association, which are from Rule R.01 to Rule R.07. In addition, the association must be marked as asymmetric expressed in Rule R.10 and Rule R.09. Figure 2.

The transformation rules from Rule R.01 and Rule R.02, and all the other rules for unidirectional associations shown in Table 1 must be applied to both ends. In addition to those rules, the inverse relation axiom must be specified. Figure 3. Visual representation of a UML bidirectional association (on the left) and OWL properties with cardinality restrictions on domain class (on the right) Rule R.11.

Declaring an inverse property in Turtle syntax :relatesTo owl:inverseOf :isRelatedTo . Listing 22. Declaring an inverse property in RDF/XML syntax In general the UML dependency connectors should be transformed by the rules specified for UML association connectors (see Table 1). The following two rules, concerning the transformation of dependency targets, are different from the rules for the transformation of association targets. Rule R.12. Dependency target — in reasoning layer Specify object property range for the target end of the dependency. Listing 23. Range specification in Turtle syntax :relationName rdfs:range skos:Concept ; . Listing 24. Range specification in RDF/XML syntax In OWL we want to state only that the range of a Dependency connector is a skos:Concept, without committing to a specific list. We do this additional restriction in the data shape. Rule R.13. Dependency range shape — in data shape layer Within the SHACL PropertyShape corresponding to a dependency relation linked to a given source UML Class, specify property constraints indicating the range class. Listing 25. Property class constraint in Turtle syntax @prefix : . @prefix shape: . @prefix sh: . shape:ClassName-relationName sh:class :EnumerationName ; . Listing 26. Property class constraint in RDF/XML syntax Generalisation defines specialization relationship between Classifiers. In case of UML Classes it relates a more specific Class to a more general Class. Figure 4. Visual representation of UML generalisation (on the left) and OWL subclass relation (on the right) UML generalisation set groups generalisations; incomplete and disjoint constraints indicate that the set is not complete and its specific Classes have no common instances. The UML conventions specify that all sibling classes are by default disjoint, therefore even if no generalisation set is provided it is assumed to be implicit. Sibling classes will be declared disjoint with one another in the reasoning layer (see Rule R.18). Rule R.14. Class generalisation — in core ontology layer Specify subclass axiom for the generalisation between UML Classes. Listing 27. Subclass declaration in Turtle syntax :ClassName rdfs:subClassOf :SuperClass. :OtherClass rdfs:subClassOf :SuperClass. Listing 28. Subclass declaration in RDF/XML syntax Generalization defines specialization relationship between Classifiers. In case of the UML associations it relates a more specific Association to more general Association. Figure 5.

Property generalisation — in core ontology layer Specify sub-property axiom for the generalisation between UML association/dependency connectors. Listing 29.

Disjoint classes — in reasoning layer Specify a disjoint classes axiom for all \"sibling\" classes, i.e. for multiple UML Classes that have generalisation connectors to the same UML Class. For the generalisation relations depicted in Figure 4, the generated output should have the following form. Listing 35.

The ultimate objective of the project is to put forth a commonly agreed ontology that will conceptualise, formally encode and make available in an open, structured and machine-readable format data about public procurement, covering end-to-end procurement, i.e. from notification, through tendering to awarding, ordering, invoicing and payment . The process and the methodology adopted involve modelling the conceptual model in Unified Modelling Language (UML) and then, by abiding a set of conventions and recommendations, transform that model into a formal ontology expressed in Web Ontology Language (OWL) . This document provides a working definition of the transformation rules from the UML conceptual model into the formal ontology and validation data shapes. These rules are organised in accordance with the eProcurement ontology architecture . Much has been written about correspondences and between and transformation from UML to OWL and vice versa . The most significant literature on this topic was published between 2006 and 2019 comprising three book chapters, nine journal papers and multiple conference papers. The work presented in transforms into OWL some selected elements of UML models containing multiple UML class, object and state-chart diagrams in order to analyse consistency of the models. A similar approach is presented in , which is focused on detecting inconsistency in models containing UML class and state-chart diagrams. The papers investigate the differences and similarities between UML and OWL in order to present transformations of selected (and identified as useful) elements of UML class diagram. In , the need for UML–OWL transformation is additionally motivated by not repeating the modelling independently in both languages. The paper compares OWL abstract syntax elements to the equivalent UML features and appropriate OCL statements. The analysis is conducted in the direction from OWL to UML. For every OWL construct its UML interpretation is proposed. The works presented in are focused on extracting ontological knowledge from UML class diagrams and describe some UML–OWL mappings with the aim to reuse the existing UML models and stream the building of OWL domain ontologies. In is presented a comprehensive review of the related work. We use it as a guideline for ensuring the necessary coverage of the transformation rules specified in this report. It is important to note here that all the UML elements are treated here, but only the ones employed in the eProcurement conceptual model. The reminder of this document comprises four sections covering major UML aspects. Section Transformation of UML classes and attributes treats classes and attributes. Following section deals with the main connector types employed in the eProcurement model, namely: associations, dependencies and generalisations. Section #sec:tran-rules3 explains how the datatypes and enumerations should be transformed and, finally, Section #sec:tran-rules4 provides a few transformation rules that are applicable to all UML elements and are concerned with comments, labels and notes. Each section provides a table with overview of the transformation rule set comprised within. The table provides three columns, one for every layer of the ontology architecture comprising rules: (a) , (b) , and (c) . Transformation rules are specified in a normative language and are aided by prototypical UML diagram fragments (usually preceding the rule) along with representation of the corresponding OWL fragment depicted in Graffoo visual notation . The diagrams are provided side to side in order to increase comprehension, with UML fragment on the left constituting the source of the transformation and the OWL fragment on the right representing the final result of the transformation. Each transformation rule is accompanied by the formal OWL representation, in Turtle and RDF/XML syntaxes, corresponding to the depicted UML fragment from the preceding figure. RDF/XML is a syntax to express RDF graphs as an XML document. Turtle is a textual syntax for RDF that is compact and resembles a natural text form with abbreviations for common usage patterns and datatypes. This section provides the main UML elements employed in this document. A detailed description can be consulted in the standard specifications and in the user guide . Figure 1.

Note that no class methods are ever employed as this document as the transformations aim at data structures only. Figure 2 depicts a primitive datatype and an enumeration. No complex datatypes are depicted as they are treated in the same manner as classes are. Figure 3 depicts association, generalisation and dependency connectors as the only ones necessary to model the eProcurement conceptual model.

The current set of UML Model Conventions are meant to guide the semantic engineers and ontology editors on producing consistent, uniform and uniquely interpretable conceptual models. Also, it is meant to help the readers of the conceptual models to interpret the meaning and eliminate any ambiguities. Finally, the conventions are fit for implementation. This set of guidelines is aligned with the SEMIC style guide [semic-style-guide] and constitutes an extension and further elaboration of it. The guidelines provided here are either of general or technical nature. They are formulated so, as to be not only easily understandable by the semantic engineer, but also to allow the implementation of automatic model checkers (see Section UML Convention checker inventory]) as well as the definition of precise transformation rules that can be implemented in tools to automatically generate the semantic derivate artefacts (see Section Transformation of the UML model into derivative artefacts]). We organized the conventions into subsections covering: general conventions, which apply to multiple model components conventions specific to particular UML elements (Classes and their Attributes, Data Types, Enumerations, Objects, Packages) general conventions on UML connectors conventions specific to particular UML connector types (Associations, Dependencies, Generalisations, Realisations) The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [rfc2119].

Description: When creating attribute names, it is conventional to use simple nouns such as \"name\", \"weight\", \"colour\". Attributes are a special type of relations that describe an entity in terms of its qualities. And so, to be consistent with the above convention and in order to increase the clarity, it is recommended to employ the prefix \"has-\" for each attribute, even if it does not add much to the term’s meaning. So, it is preferred to use terms such as \"hasName\", \"hasWeight\" and \"hasColour\". It is recommended to use simple nouns for attribute names prepended with the verb \"has-\". It is recommended to avoid duplicate attribute names across multiple classes. Unless, by design, attributes with the same name are shared across multiple classes. Title: Attribute multiplicity Identifier - Statement: Attributes shall be assigned cardinality specifications contextualised to the class carrying them. Description: The attribute multiplicity should be specified indicating the minimum and maximum cardinality. The default [1] multiplicity shall be interpreted as unspecified, and expressed as [0..*] in the OWL model. In special cases, a list of custom default multiplicities is defined for the transformation script. That means that some data types or classes that are used as attribute types are paired with a default multiplicity, for example \"1..1\", \"0..1\", \"2..2\". Title: Attribute datatypes Identifier - Statement: uml:Attribute shall be defined with generally accepted primitive datatypes. Description: Each uml:Attribute must have a name and an attribute type. uml:Attribute is mostly transformed into owl:DataProperty and in some controlled cases into owl:ObjectProperty. High preference shall be given to using OWL 2 compliant XSD [xsd] and RDF [rdf] standard datatypes. [See convention on Primitive Data types] In cases when a property needs to be defined as ranging on an unknown controlled list or authority table constitute a special case. They can be expressed as uml:Attribute with the datatype skos:Concept. These attributes are transformed into owl:ObjectProperty in a manner similarly to uml:Association. An attribute may contain an alias, used as an alternative label. It can be specified via uml:Tags. [See convention on uml:Tags] Title: Attribute name reuse Identifier - Statement: Attribute names can be reused only as attributes in other classes, not as relations. Description: It is mandatory to avoid using the same name in an attribute and in a relation, unless an additional rule that handles intentional exceptions exists. The definition and datatype (and in most cases also the multiplicity) of the attribute should be the same in all classes where it is reused.","title":"","component":"ROOT","version":"public-review","name":"conv-attributes","url":"/public-review/uml/conv-attributes.html","titles":[{"text":"Conventions on Attributes of uml:Class elements","hash":"_conventions_on_attributes_of_umlclass_elements","id":1},{"text":"Conventional recommendations on Attributes","hash":"sec:attributes","id":2},{"text":"uml:Class attributes","hash":"sec:attributes-class","id":3}]},"14":{"id":14,"text":"Title: Naming of classes Identifier - Statement: Class names shall be simple nouns or noun phrases. Description: When choosing class names, it is conventional to use simple nouns or noun phrases. In case the class refers to actions, states, relations or qualities, which are usually expressed in natural language by verbs or adjectives then they must be nominalised. We often form nouns from other parts of speech, most commonly from a verb or an adjective. We can then use the noun phrase instead of the verb or adjective to create a more formal style. This process is called nominalisation. Title: Use of singular class names Identifier - Statement: Class names shall be formulated in singular. Description: A class name represents a collection of objects. For example, a class \"Language\" actually represents all languages. Therefore, it could be more natural for some model designers to call the class \"Languages\" rather than \"Language\". In practice, however, the singular is used more often for class names, while the plural for sets and collections [noy2001]. Therefore, it is required that the class names must always use the singular lexical form. [[rule:class-name-capitalise] Title: Capitalise class names Identifier - Statement: Class names shall be written in Pascal case. Description: The local segment in the name of a uml:Class element must start with a capital letter, and multiple words must be combined based on the Pascal case rules. Title: Subclass naming Identifier - Statement: Classes in a subclass hierarchy should be named consistently. Description: When building the class hierarchy, names of direct subclasses of a class should consistently either all include or not include the name of the superclass. For example, if we create two subclasses of Wine to represent red and white wines, then the two subclass names should be either Red Wine and White Wine or Red and White, but not Red Wine and White [noy2001]. Title: Single subclass Identifier - Statement: Class specialisations with a single child shall be avoided. Description: This means that there should be at least two sibling subclasses specified in the model. By default, the classes are not disjunctive, however, if required, the transformation script may generate disjunctive classes by default. [[rule:class-circular] Title: Circular inheritance Identifier - Statement: Circular inheritance must be avoided. Description: This means that if a class B specialises a class A, then A may not specialise B or any of the subclasses of B. Title: Mandatory class names Identifier - Statement: Each uml:Class must have a short URI name. Description: uml:Class is transformed into an owl:Class. Each uml:Class must have a name. Title: Class description Identifier - Statement: Each uml:Class should have a description. Description: Each uml:Class should have a description representing the human readable class definition in the domain context. Optionally, in case there is a technical possibility to distinguish between UML notes, then additionally editorial, history notes or simply comments should be provided as class descriptors. Richer and structured descriptions can be provided by using uml:Tag(s). Title: Class properties Identifier - Statement: uml:Class must have connectors, attributes, or both. Description: It is recommended that a uml:Class has relations, attributes, or both. A class must not miss both, attributes and relations associated with it. It is mandatory to avoid using the same name in a class, attribute or a relation. Title: Abstract Classes Identifier - Statement: A uml:Class may use the > stereotype to signal that the class is not instantiatable. Description: Classes may use the > stereotype. It means that no instances are allowed of this class in the datasets. This is not covered by the OWL 2 [owl2] but can be expressed in SHACL data shapes [shacl-spec].","title":"","component":"ROOT","version":"public-review","name":"conv-classes","url":"/public-review/uml/conv-classes.html","titles":[{"text":"Conventions on uml:Class elements","hash":"_conventions_on_umlclass_elements","id":1},{"text":"Conventional recommendations on Classes","hash":"sec:classes","id":2},{"text":"Technical conventions on uml:Class elements","hash":"sec:uml-class","id":3}]},"15":{"id":15,"text":"Title: uml:Associations connect classes to classes or objects Identifier - Statement: uml:Association elements connect two uml:Classes, or a uml:Class to a uml:Object. Description: The uml:Association connectors represent relations between source and target classes, or a source class and an object target. The association connector cannot be used between other kinds of UML elements. Title: uml:Association connector name Identifier - Statement: uml:Association connectors shall have no name specified. They shall have a valid target role (and optionally a source role) name specified. Description: An Association connector shall have no name specified (see the General convention on connector names). An Association connector shall have a target role specified. The target role name is used to specify the property that this connector represents. Optionally, a source role may also be provided. In this case the relation direction must be changed from \"Source→Target\" to \"Bidirectional\". Or conversely, if the connector direction is \"Bidirectional\" then source and target roles must be provided. No other directions are permitted. The role name(s) must be valid, as it is used to generate the OWL property URI(s). Title: uml:Association multiplicity Identifier - Statement: uml:Association connectors shall have their target multiplicity specified. If source role is specified, also their source multiplicity must be specified. Description: The target and source multiplicity must be specified accordingly indicating the minimum and maximum cardinality. Title: uml:Association definition Identifier - Statement: uml:Association connector shall have a definition. Description: It is recommended that each association has a definition. The definition is then used for each role as they stand for the same meaning manifested in the inverse direction. Additionally, specific definitions can be specified along the target and source roles.","title":"","component":"ROOT","version":"public-review","name":"conv-conn-association","url":"/public-review/uml/conv-conn-association.html","titles":[{"text":"Conventions on uml:Association Connectors","hash":"sec:association","id":1}]},"16":{"id":16,"text":"[[rule:dependency-btw-class-and-enum-or-object rule:dependency-btw-class-and-enum-or-object]] Title: uml:Dependency connects classes to enumerations or objects Identifier - Statement: uml:Dependency connectors connect a uml:Class element to a uml:Enumeration element or a uml:Object element. Description: The dependency connector may be used between uml:Class and uml:Enumeration or uml:Object boxes, oriented from the class towards the enumeration or object. It indicates the class has an owl:ObjectProperty whose range is a controlled vocabulary. The connector must have direction \"Source→Target\". No other directions are acceptable. Title: uml:Dependency connector name Identifier - Statement: uml:Dependency connectors shall have no name specified. They shall have a valid target role name specified. Description: A Dependency connector shall have no name specified (see the General convention on connector names). A Dependency connector shall have only a target role specified. The target role name must be valid, as it is used to generate the OWL property URI that this connector represents. The source role of the Dependency connector shall not be specified. Title: uml:Dependency multiplicity Identifier - Statement: uml:Dependency connectors shall have their target multiplicity specified. Description: The multiplicity must be specified at the target of the uml:Dependency connector indicating the minimum and maximum cardinality. In the transformation process, for the reasoning purposes, the range of the property must be expressed as a range restriction using owl:oneOf the values from the enumeration Concept scheme. This is also valuable for generating SHACL shapes.","title":"","component":"ROOT","version":"public-review","name":"conv-conn-dependency","url":"/public-review/uml/conv-conn-dependency.html","titles":[{"text":"Conventions on uml:Dependency Connectors","hash":"sec:dependency","id":1}]},"17":{"id":17,"text":"Title: uml:Generalization connects two classes or two connectors Identifier - Statement: uml:Generalization connectors connect a uml:Class element to its superclass uml:Class element, or a uml:Connector to its super-property uml:Connector.

Description: The uml:Generalization connectors must have no name (see the General convention on connector names) nor source/target roles specified in the UML model. Title: uml:Generalization connector with no multiplicity Identifier - Statement: uml:Generalization connectors shall have no target or source multiplicity specified. Description: The multiplicity must not be specified neither at the target nor at the source end of the uml:Generalization connector. Title: Proxy classes Identifier - Statement: For classes defined in external models proxy uml:Class elements should be defined. Description: In case a model class should inherit a class from an external model then proxies must be created for those classes. For example, if Buyer specialises an org:Organization, then a proxy for org:Organization must be created in the org package. Title: Disjoint subclasses Identifier - Statement: Subclasses of the same class, represented by multiple uml:Generalization connectors pointing to the same superclass, are assumed disjoint by default. Exceptions may exist and can be encoded. Description: In this specification, the subclasses are assumed disjoint by default, unless otherwise specified in the transformations script, or explicitly marked on the generalisation relation with > stereotype. For the converse case the > stereotype shall be used. Title: Equivalent classes Identifier - Statement: Equivalent classes can be represented by using stereotypes on the uml:Generalization connectors. Description: In case two classes are equivalent, then the \\(>\\) or \\(>\\) stereotype should be used as a marker.","title":"","component":"ROOT","version":"public-review","name":"conv-conn-generalization","url":"/public-review/uml/conv-conn-generalization.html","titles":[{"text":"Conventions on uml:Generalization Connectors","hash":"sec:genaralization","id":1}]},"18":{"id":18,"text":"Title: uml:Realization connects objects with classes or enumerations Identifier - Statement: uml:Realization connectors connect a uml:Object element to a uml:Class or uml:Enumeration element. Description: The uml:Realization connector signifies an instantiation relation, and is transformed into rdf:type relation standing between the source object and the target class. In case the target is a uml:Enumeration element (and the enum is converted into a skos:ConceptScheme instance, and the object into a skos:Concept), then the relation should be translated into a skos:inScheme relation. Title: uml:Realization connector with no name Identifier - Statement: uml:Realization connectors shall have no name or a target role specified. Description: The uml:Realization connectors must have no name (see the General convention on connector names) nor source/target roles specified in the UML model.

Description: The multiplicity must not be specified neither at the target nor at the source end of the uml:Realization connector. Title: Proxy objects Identifier - Statement: For objects defined in external models proxy uml:Object elements should be defined. Description: In case an object that is to be used in this model is defined in an external model a proxy uml:Object element should be created so that we can connect it to classes in our model. For example, if we want to refer to the time:unitMonth instance of the class time:TemporalUnit, then a proxy for time:unitMonth individual (and in this case also of the class time:TemporalUnit) must be created (ideally in a dedicated time package).","title":"","component":"ROOT","version":"public-review","name":"conv-conn-realization","url":"/public-review/uml/conv-conn-realization.html","titles":[{"text":"Conventions on uml:Realization Connectors","hash":"sec:realization","id":1}]},"19":{"id":19,"text":"Title: Naming relations Identifier - Statement: Relations are to be expressed through UML Connectors. It is recommended to use a verb in the relation names. Description: When establishing relations between concepts it is conventional to use verbs of action, state, process or relation, such as \"includes\", \"replaces\", \"manages\". It is required to use a verb or a verb phrase for relationship terms. It should be in lowerCamelCase such that \\(\\) triples may actually be read as natural language clauses, e.g. \"EconomicOperator offers ProcuredItem\" [d2.01-2017]. The verb phrase must be in present tense, and, if needed, inflected for third person singular. If an additional level of specificity is needed a qualifying nominal phrase may be appended. The relation names should be provided as target, and in case of bidirectional association relations also source, role names. For more details on this, see convention about [UML Connector names]. Title: Bidirectional relations Identifier - Statement: Relationships are usually bidirectional, and the name for both directions should be provided, where it makes sense. Description: Relationships are usually bidirectional, and the names of the relations in both directions should be provided, where it makes sense from the modeling point of view. Adjust the verb phrases in the predicates as appropriate. Usually, by employing the active and passive voice in the term formulation brings the desired result. For example, \"uses/isUsedBy\" and \"refersTo/isReferredToBy\" or \"offers/isOfferedBy\" [d2.01-2017]. Title: Inverse relation Identifier - Statement: Semantically inverse relationships should be represented as two distinct UML connectors. Description: The name of the inverse relation should not be semantically inverted verb, such as in case of \"buys/sells\" , \"open/closes\". The semantically inverted dichotomies must be modelled in separate connectors because they represent different relations. For example the dichotomy \"buys/sells\" should be modelled as two pairs: \"buys/isBoughtBy\" and \"sells/isSoldBy\". When the relation is of different nature, more like an attribute, then prefixing and suffixing techniques can be employed. For example, in the Organization Ontology [org-ontology], the concepts of an \"Organization\" and a \"Site\" are defined along with two relationships that are the inverse of each other: \"Organisation hasSite Site\" and \"Site siteOf Organisation\" [d3.1-2015]. Title: Definition of inverse relations Identifier - Statement: It is recommended that the definition of both the relation and its inverse relation is provided. Description: It is recommended that each relationship includes a definition of its inverse. Models should define such inverse pairs for relationships although this does not extend to attributes. For example, Dublin Core [dublin-core-metadata] includes a property of \"dateAccepted\", there is no inverse property that would link a given date, which is expressed as a simple value, to all the documents accepted for publication on that date. Title: UML Connector names Identifier - Statement: The name of a uml:Connector shall not be specified. For named relations, represented by uml:Association and uml:Dependency connectors, the relation names are to be specified as the target/source role names. Description: A generic UML connector may have a name applied to it, and, in addition, it may also have source/target roles specified. This provides flexibility for how the domain knowledge may be expressed in UML. However, this freedom increases the level of ambiguity as well. To reduce ambiguity, streamline the modeling process, and simplify the transformation rules, we convened to express named relations using the connector source/target ends. This convention prescribes that the name of any of the supported uml:Connector types (see Supported UML connectors) should not be specified. For uml:Association and uml:Dependency connectors the name of the relation (and the property to be generated) should be specified through the target role name of the connector. Additionally, for bidirectional uml:Association connectors the source role name should be specified as well. See conventions on Association name and Dependency name. The role name(s) must be valid, as it is used to generate the OWL property URI. Title: Direction of UML Connectors Identifier - Statement: All uml:Connectors must employ \"Source→Target\" directions only, with uml:Association connectors allowing also \"Bidirectional\" direction. Description: All supported UML connectors shall have direction \"Source→Target\". In addition, uml:Association connectors can also be \"Bidirectional\". Title: Reuse of UML Connector roles Identifier - Statement: Connector role names can be reused, but only as role names in other connectors of the same type. Description: Connector role names can be reused, but only as role names in other connectors of the same type. That is, uml:Association role names can be reused only as role names in other uml:Association connectors, and uml:Dependency role names can be reused only as role names in other uml:Dependency connectors. No other connector role name reuse is permitted. The definition of the connector (and its role) should be the same in all occurrences where its target/source role is reused. In most cases this should apply also to the multiplicity of the reused connector roles. See also generic conventions about also Uniqueness and reuse of names and Reuse of relations.","title":"","component":"ROOT","version":"public-review","name":"conv-connectors","url":"/public-review/uml/conv-connectors.html","titles":[{"text":"Modeling Relations with UML Connectors","hash":"_modeling_relations_with_uml_connectors","id":1},{"text":"Conventional recommendations on Relations","hash":"sec:relations","id":2},{"text":"Technical conventions on connectors","hash":"sec:connectors","id":3},{"text":"Reuse of Relations","hash":"sec:relations-reuse","id":4}]},"20":{"id":20,"text":"Title: Primitive vs. composite datatypes Identifier - Statement: Composite data types shall be represented as uml:Class elements. Primitive data types, if needed to be modelled, shall be represented as uml:DataType elements. Description: This convention draws the distinction between primitive (or atomic) types (consisting of single literal value) and composite types (consisting of multiple attributes) [isaHandbook2015]. In fact, the composite datatypes must be defined as classes and handled as such. For example: AmountType, Identifier, Quantity and Measure are to be treated as classes even if conceptually they could be seen as composite data types. Title: XSD and RDF datatypes Identifier - Statement: For primitive data types the already existing (standardized or commonly used) datatypes, in particular those from XSD and RDF, shall be reused. Description: It is recommended to employ the primitive datatypes that are already defined in XSD [xsd1.1-spec] and RDF [rdf11], which cover the standard and most common types. Thus, definitions of custom data types shall be avoided unless the model really needs them. Such cases are, however, rare. The data types defined in the UML model (and custom ones) are resolved into their XSD equivalent using the correspondences from the Table 1 table below. Note that the family of string datatypes is mapped to rdf:langString. This means that the instance data should provide a language tag for the textual data indicating how it should be read. This enables multilingual data specification. Also, note that Date is mapped to xsd:date and DateTime is mapped to xsd:dateTime. However, the xsd:date is not included in the OWL2 interpretation and instead a strong preference is expressed for xsd:dateTime. Therefore, it is recommended to follow the OWL2 specification, although the xsd:date is a valid datatype in the RDF data and in SPARQL queries. Note that from the family of string datatypes we recommend using the following ones (in this order of preference): rdf:PlainLiteral, rdfs:Literal, xsd:string, and rdf:langString. Often enabling multilingual data specification is a necessity. Table 1. UML to XSD datatype correspondences UML XSD Boolean xsd:boolean Float xsd:float Integer xsd:integer Char, Character, String rdf:langString Short xsd:short Long xsd:long Decimal xsd:decimal Date xsd:date DateTime xsd:dateTime xsd:anyURI Code skos:Concept The table above provides a simplified correspondence between UML and XSD datatypes, but for a complete list of available recommended datatypes the standard specifications shall be consulted: RDF working group XSD Datatype maps RDF 1.1 Datatypes section OWL 2 Datatype Maps Title: OWL 2 datatypes Identifier - Statement: Whenever possible, OWL 2 compliant XSD and RDF datatypes shall be used. Description: We strongly recommended the use of OWL 2 compliant XSD and RDF standard datatypes, if possible. They might be useful also for indicating a specific datatype, which is impossible with the UML ones. For example, making a distinction between a general string (xsd:string) and a literal with a language tag (rdf:langString), or XML encoded ones such as rdf:HTML and rdf:XMLLiteral. Title: Proxy datatypes Identifier - Statement: For already existing datatypes proxy uml:DataType elements should be defined. Description: For the model consistency, it is recommended that the proxy data types be defined in the model for the XSD[1] and RDF data types[2] used in the model. The proxies must follow the standard namespace convention using the rdf: and xsd: prefixes. Title: Datatypes references Identifier - Statement: uml:DataType elements shall not connect to other elements. They can only be referred to. Description: There should be no outgoing connector from a uml:DataType element. uml:DataType elements should only be referred to, most commonly, by being used as the type of a uml:Attribute element. Declarations of uml:DataType elements that are not referred to should be avoided in order to keep the model lean and clean. 1. https://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/wiki/XSD_Datatypes 2. https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Datatypes","title":"","component":"ROOT","version":"public-review","name":"conv-datatypes","url":"/public-review/uml/conv-datatypes.html","titles":[{"text":"Conventions on uml:DataType elements","hash":"_conventions_on_umldatatype_elements","id":1},{"text":"Conventional recommendations on datatypes","hash":"_conventional_recommendations_on_datatypes","id":2},{"text":"Technical conventions on uml:DataType elements","hash":"sec:uml-datatype","id":3}]},"21":{"id":21,"text":"In UML the controlled lists, discussed in Section [Controlled List] are represented as uml:Enumeration.

Title: Interpretation of uml:Enumeration Identifier - Statement: An uml:Enumeration element is transformed into skos:ConceptScheme, and an enumeration item into a skos:Concept. Description: Each uml:Enumeration element is transformed into skos:ConceptScheme, and each enumeration item, if present as an uml:Attribute value, is transformed into a skos:Concept. An enumeration might be empty, especially when they refer to externally specified controlled lists. In a uml:Enumeration element, the name shall be interpreted as the controlled list name; it must be a normalised string. Each attribute name is used as a local segment in the generation of the concept URI. The attribute type is ignored and by default is considered to be skos:Concept. The attribute alias is transformed into the `skos:Concept`s preferred label. The attribute initial value is transformed into the alternative label of the concept. In case no attribute alias is specified then the attribute name is used as preferred label of the skos:Concept. This happens as skos:prefLabel is a mandatory property in the SKOS model. It is possible to employ the enumerations for class properties by drawing a dependency (uml:Dependency) relation from the class to the enumeration and provide a relation target role.

Regarding the topic of these conventions we start with some fundamental ones, and then we cover a number of generic areas: from naming things, to providing appropriate descriptions, to generic recommendations on technical aspects of encoding such information. For each of such topic we will start with conventional recommendations, followed by technical conventions, if both aspects are relevant. To reduce the complexity of UML models that one can build, and the conversion of those UML models into derivative artefacts (i.e. OWL ontologies and SHACL shapes), we identified a minimal set of UML model components (UML elements and connectors) that are necessary and sufficient to express most ontological statements that might be needed in practice. For this minimal set of UML model components we convened on a well-defined set of transformation rules to ensure that the generation of derivative artefacts is deterministic and complete. The use of other UML components will be ignored. Title: Supported UML model elements Identifier - Statement: The UML model shall contain only the following types of UML elements: Class, DataType, Enumeration, Object and Package. Description: The Model2OWL tool deals only with the conversion of the following UML elements: Class, DataType, Enumeration, Object and Package. Other UML elements will be ignored, and therefore should not be used. Title: Supported UML connectors Identifier - Statement: The UML model shall contain only the following types of UML Connectors: Association, Dependency, Generalization and Realization. Description: The Model2OWL tool deals only with the conversion of the following UML connectors: Association, Dependency, Generalization and Realization. Other types of UML connectors will be ignored, and therefore should not be used. Title: UML model components should be public Identifier - Statement: All UML model elements and connectors must be declared with the visibility set to \"Public\". Description: This convention also includes that the UML class attributes have their visibility (or \"Scope\") set to \"Public\", and that all named roles specified at either end of any of the connectors have their visibility (or \"Access\") set to \"Public\". Defining naming and structural conventions for concepts in an ontology, and then strictly adhering to these conventions, don’t only make the ontology easier to understand, but also helps avoid some common modelling mistakes. UML is a language without formal semantics. Moreover, it is quite flexible and permissive with ways in which a concept can be expressed. Also, there are many alternatives in naming concepts. Often there is no particular reason to choose one or another alternative. However, we need to define a set of naming conventions for classes, relations, attributes, controlled lists and adhere to it [noy2001]. In theory any name can be assigned to a concept, relationship or property. In practice, there are two types of constraints on the kind of names that should be used: technical and conventional. This section deals with conventional recommendations, while the technical aspects are covered in later sections, such as [Namespaces], [Character encoding], and [Stereotypes and Tags] . Title: Support for generation of human- and machine-readable denominations Identifier - Statement: Element names should support generation of human- and machine-readable denominations, and they shall follow the short URI notation: prefix:localSegment . Description: The naming conventions apply to the element names in the conceptual model. These names are intended for further use as human-readable denominations, called labels; and machine-readable denominations, called identifiers. The identifiers serve as a basis for generating URIs [rfc3986] to ensure unambiguous reference to a formal construct; while the labels are meant to ease the comprehension by human-readers. For this reason we will consider that mostly the conventional recommendations provided here apply to them and none of the technical constraints. Title: Recommendation on language Identifier - Statement: Element names shall be formulated using British English. Multilingual support, if needed, should be provided through additional labels. Description: It is recommended that the names and descriptions for classes and properties are expressed in British English [d2.01-2017]. In addition, a mechanism for providing a multilingual labelling system should be adopted. Title: Namespace definition Identifier - Statement: All prefixes used in the element names must refer to a valid namespace declaration, including a default namespace. Description: The names should also belong to and be organised by namespaces. They can be provided as a short prefix to the elements name, for example \"org:Organization\", \"epo:Notice\" or \"skos:Concept\". Namespaces are addressed in detail in Section [Namespaces]. See also: SEMIC Style Guide Rules [GC-R4], [SC-R3] and [CMC-R6] Title: Use clear language Identifier - Statement: Clear and plain language shall be used; and abbreviations, unpronounceable, easily confusable, cryptic, and other difficult terms shall be avoided in element names. Description: It is recommended to avoid abbreviations in concept names. Also, the words employed in the metamodel such as \"class\", \"property\", \"attribute\", \"connector\" etc. should be avoided as well. Names that are nonsensical, unpronounceable, hard to read, or easily confusable with other names should not be employed [xml1-spec]. Title: Case sensitivity Identifier - Statement: Names are case-sensitive. Names of elements of the same type should use consistent capitalisation. Description: We can greatly improve the readability of an ontology if we use consistent capitalisation for concept names. For example, it is common to capitalise class names and use lower case for property names. And so, the names of classes, data-types and enumerations must begin with a capital letter while the names of class attributes, enumeration items, association and dependency relations, including their source and target roles, must begin with a lower case character. All the names are case-sensitive. This means that the class \"Buyer\" and the attribute \"buyer\" are two different names. Nonetheless, such similarities are strongly discouraged and more elaborated names are highly encouraged. For example, a simple elaboration is to use suffixes or prefixes. See rules: Title: Delimitation in multi-word names Identifier - Statement: Names containing multiple words shall use camelCase or PascalCase as word delimiting mechanism. Description: In UML, the spaces in names are allowed and using them may be the most intuitive solution for many ontology developers. It is however, important to consider other systems with which your system may interact. If those systems do not use spaces or if your presentation medium does not handle spaces well, it can be useful to use another method [noy2001]. It is recommended that the element names avoid using spaces and instead follow a camel-case convention. CamelCasing is the practice of writing phrases such that the word or abbreviation in the middle of the phrase begins with a capital case. Exceptionally, if the conceptual model authors must maintain high readability of the UML diagrams, spaces may be tolerated and handled by the conversion script. In the conversion process, spaces are trimmed and phrases turned into camel-case form. For example \" Pre-award catalogue request \" is transformed into \"Pre-AwardCatalogueRequest\". Title: Name uniqueness and reuse Identifier - Statement: Element names (Class, Datatype, Enumeration, Object, Package) must be unique, while the Attribute and Connector role names, with certain restrictions, can be reused. Description: In the formal ontology, each class, property or individual must be uniquely identifiable by its identifier. Therefore, the elements of the conceptual model, classes, attributes, connectors, instance, should have unique names. This means that there cannot exist a class and an attribute with the same name (such as a class \"Buyer\" and a property \"Buyer\"). Neither can there exist a class and an instance, or an instance and a relation, with the same name. Names that reduce to the same identifier are considered the same. For example \"Legal Entity\" and \"LegalEntity\" are different labels, but they reduce to the same identifier \"LegalEntity\". In such cases the names are considered equal and the UML elements replicated. Although name uniqueness is a recommendation, sometimes it is useful to replicate a UML element. In such cases, when the names are reused, the assumption is that the two UML elements represent manifestations of the same meaning. This is especially important for relations, and is explained in convention [[rule:gen-relation-reuse]]. The names of the following THINGS shall be unique against the OTHER THINGS (i.e. shall not be reused as names of the other things): elements (Class, DataType, Enumeration, Object, Package) → elements, attributes, connector roles (dependency & association) attributes → elements, connector roles (dependency & association) connector role (dependecy & association) → elements, attributes dependency connector role → association connector role association connector role → dependency connector role Title: Reuse of relations Identifier - Statement: Connector and Attribute names shall be chosen such as to support the appropriate level of reuse. Description: The relation names should be chosen so that there is a balance of accuracy and precision on one hand and the relation reusability on the other hand. These two dimensions are inversely correlated: the higher the reuse the lower the accuracy and vice versa. On one hand, if we choose more generic predicates such as \"isSpecifiedIn\" this tends towards maximising relation reusability across the model. Yet at the same time the risk of overloading the relation meaning also increases. On the other hand, the above risk could be mitigated by simply appending the range class to the relation name: such \"isSpecifiedInContract\" and such \"isSpecifiedInProcedure\" following the following naming pattern: . This ensures predicate uniqueness and maximum level of specificity at the cost of reusability across and beyond the model. The latter can be achieved through inference, but an additional predicate inheritance structure must be defined. Another risk is that a change or evolution of the name of the class has a direct impact on all incoming predicates, and thus raising the chances of errors. This in turn may decrease the model agility and elasticity. Optionally, the transformation process from the conceptual model to the formal ontology, may contain a mechanism of appending the name of the range class to the predicate name in order to automatically produce a predicate with higher specificity, shall this be required. Title: Use of suffixes and prefixes Identifier - Statement: Attributes and connector names shall contain a verb. Apply certain, well establish, prefixes and/or suffixes, in a consistent fashion, to achieve this goal. Description: Some ontology engineering methodologies suggest using prefix and suffix conventions in the names to distinguish between classes and attributes. Two common practices are to add a \"has-\" prefix or a \"-of\" suffix to attribute names. Thus, our attributes become \"hasAwardStatus\" and ”hasBuyer” if we chose the \"has-\" convention. The attributes become \"awardStatusOf\" and \"buyerOf\" if we chose the \"-of\" convention. This approach allows anyone looking at a term to determine immediately if the term is a class or an attribute. However, the term names become slightly longer [noy2001]. We recommend that the names of class attributes employ the \"has-\" suffix. For boolean properties we recommend the use of the \"is-\" prefix. Other common suffixes are the prepositions \"-by\" and \"-to\". The organisation ontology [org-ontology] exemplifies their usage in cases such as \"embodiedBy\" and \"conformsTo\". However, if the preposition can be avoided, then do so [d3.1-2015]. It is recommended to use prepositions in the ontology terms only if necessary (CN: I would say: every time when it makes the meaning more clear) Optionally common and descriptive prefixes and suffixes for related properties or classes may be used. While they are just labels and their names have no inherent semantic meaning, it is still a useful way for humans to cluster and understand the vocabulary. For example, properties about languages or tools might contain suffixes such as \"Language\" (e.g. \"displayLanguage\") or \"Tool\" (e.g. \"validationTool\") for all related properties [d2.01-2017]. See also: SEMIC Style Guide Rule [GC-R4] Large emphasis is set on the naming conventions. Nonetheless, most often, a good name is insufficient for an accurate or easy comprehension by human-readers. To mitigate this, and to increase the conceptual richness, practitioners may wish to provide human-readable definitions, notes, examples and comments grasping the underlying assumptions, usage examples, additional explanations and other types of information. Title: Description of elements Identifier - Statement: All elements must have a definition providing a concise but complete description of the concept. Description: We adopt here the SEMIC Principles for creating good definitions [semic-defs]. They are based on advice found in the literature and are the following: Be concise but complete, Avoid over-generalisations. Adapt and contextualise the definition to the surrounding/connected concepts. Make sure that every concept that occurs in the model is directly (or indirectly) defined Describe only one term Structure the definition in a standardised way: Use the singular form to phrase the definition (see [Naming Conventions]) State what the term is, and don’t enumerate what it is NOT (i.e. no negative definition) Use only commonly understood abbreviations Use similar terminology for definitions of related concepts Don’t use circular definitions, i.e. the term defined should not be part of the definition, Don’t add secondary information such as additional explanation, scoping, examples, etc. these are to be documented in usage notes. Form the definition in one or more sentences that start with a capital letter and end with a period. Do not start a definition with a repetition of the name of the concept. In addition to these SEMIC recommendation for providing good definitions, we also add the following recommendations to adequately complete the description of an element: It is recommended that each element is defined by a crisp, one-line definition. The definition starts with a capital letter and ends with a period. A description may provide complementary information concerning the usage of the element or its relation to relevant standards. For example, a description may contain recommendations about which controlled vocabularies to use, describe the underlying assumptions and additional explanations for reducing ambiguity. Descriptions may contain multiple paragraphs separated by blank lines. The descriptions should not paraphrase the definitions. If the model editor provides concrete examples of possible element values or instances then they shall be provided as a comma-separated list. Each example value is enclosed in quotes and is optionally followed by a short explanation enclosed in parentheses [isaHandbook2015]. See also: SEMIC Style Guide Rule [GC-R5], which provides more recommendations to be followed here. The controlled list is a carefully selected list of words and phrases and is often employed in the modelling practices. The controlled list has a name, and a set of terms. For example, the list of grammatical genders can be named \"Gender\" and comprise the terms \"masculine\", \"feminine\", \"neuter\" and \"utrum\". As a rule of thumb, but not always, the relationship between the controlled list as a whole and its comprising elements can be informally conceptualised as a class-instance, class-subclass, set-item, or part-whole. Title: Representation of known controlled lists Identifier - Statement: When the controlled list is known, and it can be referred to by a short URI, then it shall be represented as uml:Enumeration element. Description: Controlled lists play an essential role in establishing interoperability standards. Management and publication of controlled lists should happen as a separate process, and are not addressed here. References to controlled lists shall be done via uml:Enumeration elements. The expectation is that the controlled lists are published in accordance with best practices and represented with the SKOS model using persistent identifiers. In such an approach, the controlled list is expressed as a skos:ConceptScheme and the specific values as skos:Concept(s). Also, such controlled lists are often developed, published and maintained independently following their own lifecycle, so that they can be reused in other models. Two use-cases can be identified in practice: (a) when the code list is known and is explicitly referred to as the range of a property, and (b) when a property is modelled but no code list reference is provided as its range. Title: Representation of unknown controlled lists Identifier - Statement: When the controlled list is unknown, then it shall not be referred to, but instead a class uml:Attribute shall be defined with datatype skos:Concept class. Description: When the authors of a conceptual model intend to omit which controlled list shall be used, then a class attribute with the range skos:Concept (in some cases Code is preferred, but we strongly recommend avoiding this) can be created to indicate that. This approach can be useful in situations when multiple (external) controlled lists can be used interchangeably. For example, the adms:status property of a dcat:CatalogueRecord shall be a skos:Concept, without specifying the controlled list. Title: Controlled list values Identifier - Statement: uml:Enumeration shall contain no values. Management of the controlled list of values shall be done outside the scope of the conceptual model. Description: It is advisable, however, to be specific concerning which controlled list shall be used. In such cases, an Enumeration shall be created representing the controlled list. The Enumeration shall be empty, i.e., not specifying any value, because the values are assumed to be maintained externally and only the reference is necessary. The properties having this controlled list as range shall be depicted as UML dependency connectors between a Class and an Enumeration [uml:Dependency]. For example, in ePO, dct:Location can have a country code represented as a dependency relation to at-voc:country (the country authority table published on the EU Vocabularies website). The name of the Enumeration shall be resolved to a URI identical to that of the skos:ConceptScheme. As for the connector type we recommend using a dependency connector (depicted with a dashed line) because the semantic interpretation differs slightly from the association connector (depicted with a continuous line). Namely, the range of the property has to fulfil two constraints: (a) instantiating the skos:Concept class and (b) being skos:inScheme the intended controlled list [epo-arch]. More specific requirements on the uml:Enumeration elements are provided in the Section [uml:Enumeration]. In order to enable the reuse of names defined in other models and reuse of unique references for names that support easy identification, namespace management must be considered. We adopt XML approach to defining and managing namespaces as it is inherent in both XMI and OWL2 standards. Hence, a namespace is a set of symbols that are used to organise objects of various kinds, so that these objects may be referred to by name and uniquely identifiable. Title: Known namespaces Identifier - Statement: Namespaces must be defined before used in the model. All prefixes shall be assigned a base URI. Description: A namespace organises a collection of names obeying three constraints: each name is (1) unique, (2) assigned consistently, and (3) assigned according to a common definition [urn-rfc8141]. An (expanded) name in a namespace is a pair consisting of a namespace name, also called base URI or just base, and a local name, also called local segment [xml1-spec, urn-rfc2141]. The combination of universally managed URIs with the vocabulary local name is effective in avoiding name clashes. For example, in the expanded name http://www.w3.org/ns/org#Organization, http://www.w3.org/ns/org# is the namespace name and Organization is the local name. In the formal ontology, the URIs must conform to RDF [rdf11] and XML[xml1-spec] format specifications. Both languages effectively require that terms begin with an upper or lower case letter from the ASCII character set, or an underscore (_). This tight restriction means that, for example, terms may not begin with a number, hyphen or accented character [d3.1-2015]. Although underscores are permitted, they are discouraged as they may be, in some cases, misread as spaces. A formal definition of these restrictions is given in the XML specification document [xml1-spec]. Title: Valid characters in element and connector names Identifier - Statement: Local names of elements should start with a letter or underscore. Description: It is required that the names use words beginning with an upper or lower case letter (A–Z, a–z) or an underscore (_) for all terms in the model. Digits (0–9) are allowed in the subsequent character positions. Also, as mentioned above, spaces are permitted in the local segment of the name. Title: URI character sets Identifier - Statement: Element names shall use only ASCII characters to generate valid URIs. UTF-8, UTF-16 and other character encodings should be avoided in the element names as they will lead to creation of IRIs. Description: Encoded UTF-8 and UTF-16 names may be used [xml1-spec, xml11-spec], but we recommend avoiding any character encodings in the element names. Encoded characters are mostly not readable and require a decoding to become human friendly. Also, unexpected results may occur in the transformation script. This recommendation does not apply to the content strings such as descriptions, notes and comments, which may use any character encoding. Title: Stereotypes Identifier - Statement: Stereotypes have no semantics and hence shall be avoided. Exceptionally, some selected, agreed-upon stereotypes may be used. Description: The use of stereotypes is not recommended. There should be only a small set of stereotypes, with well-defined meaning and pre-established transformation rules that shall be used in the conceptual model. In this set of rules the > stereotype is adopted to mark abstract classes [see convention on Abstract Classes]. See also: SEMIC Style Guide Rule [CMC-R17] Title: Tags Identifier - Statement: UML tags shall be used to provide additional descriptions of the element in a consistent and structure manner. Description: When providing additional information to an element (classes, enumerations, datatypes, connectors, attributes, connector roles) through a tag ensure that: The tag name should be provided and should be either a short URI or short URI with a language tag (e.g. @en). There should be a value associated to each tag that appears on an element. Note: Tags should not be used as the sole (or primary) source of concept identifier generation, i.e. every UML element that has tags attached, should, in the first place, have a proper name provided, according to the conventions in the [Naming Conventions] section.","title":"","component":"ROOT","version":"public-review","name":"conv-general","url":"/public-review/uml/conv-general.html","titles":[{"text":"General Conventions","hash":"sec:general-conv","id":1},{"text":"Generic conventions on the UML Model","hash":"sec:general-model","id":2},{"text":"Naming Conventions","hash":"sec:names","id":3},{"text":"Notes, descriptions and comments","hash":"sec:descriptions","id":4},{"text":"Controlled lists","hash":"sec:controlled-lists","id":5},{"text":"Namespaces","hash":"sec:namespaces","id":6},{"text":"Character encoding","hash":"sec:charset","id":7},{"text":"Stereotypes and Tags","hash":"sec:stereotypes-tags","id":8}]},"23":{"id":23,"text":"The generic conventions that are defined for all UML elements in the General conventions section apply also for the uml:Object element.

They often would serve as a \"proxy\" for an individual, or SKOS concept, defined outside the current model. Title: Relations of Objects Identifier - Statement: uml:Object element shall have no outgoing connectors, except uml:Realization connector(s) to some Class or Enumeration.

They come from the worlds of: enterprise architecture, software engineering and design and formal knowledge representation. It is therefore necessary to establish the terms, especially the common ones, by defining what they mean in each of these domains. A conceptual model is a representation of a system that uses concepts to form said representation. A concept can be viewed as an idea or notion; a unit of thought [skos-spec]. However, what constitutes a unit of thought is subjective, and this definition is meant to be suggestive, rather than restrictive. That is why each concept needs to be well named by providing preferred and alternative labels, and a clear and precise definition supported by examples and explanatory notes. The conceptual model comprises representations of concepts, their qualities or attributes and relationships to other concepts. Most commonly these are association and generalisation relations. In addition, behaviour can be represented, ranging from the concept level up to the level of the system as a whole. Behavioural aspects, however, fall out of the scope in the current specification, which addresses at the structural elements mainly. The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental, modelling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualise the design of a system [uml-userguide]. This set of specifications is based on the assumption that the conceptual models are represented with UML. Moreover, for the purposes of this convention only the structural elements of UML are considered, and in particular those comprising a class diagram. Next, the most important structural elements are introduced. A class represents a discrete concept within the domain being modelled. It is a description of a set of individual objects that share the same attributes, behaviour, relationships. Graphically, a class is rendered as a rectangle [uml-userguide]. An instance or individual object is a discrete (run-time) entity with identity, state and invocable behaviour and which can be distinguished from other (run-time) entities. We say that an individual object instantiates a class and represents a concrete (run-time) manifestation of that class. Conversely, a class represents the abstract concept by which to understand and describe the multitude of instantiated individual objects. A property is a structural feature which represents some named part of the structure of a class and characterises it in a particular fashion. It can be an attribute of a classifier or a member end of a relation. An attribute is a named property of a class that describes the type and a range of values that instances of the property may hold. An attribute may be conceptualised as a slot shared by all objects of that class that is filled by values through instantiation [uml-userguide]. When building abstractions very few classes stand alone. Instead most of them are connected to each other in a number of different ways. In UML, there are three kinds of relationships that are important in this specification: dependencies, which represent using relationships among classes (including refinement, trace, and bind relationships); generalisations, which link generalised classes to their specialisations; and associations, which represent structural relationships among objects. Each of these relationships provides a different way of combining your abstractions [uml-userguide]. When a class participates in an association, it has a specific role that it plays in that relationship. A role is the face the class at the near end of the association presents to the class at the other end of the association. It is possible to explicitly name the role a class plays in an association [uml-userguide]. An association represents a structural relationship among objects. In many modelling situations, it’s important for you to state how many objects may be connected across an instance of an association. This ``how many'' is called the multiplicity of an association’s role, and is written as an expression that evaluates to a range of values or an explicit value. It is possible to show a multiplicity of exactly one [1], zero or one [0..1], many [0..], one or more [1..], or even an exact number (for example, 3) [uml-userguide]. Multiplicity applies not only to associations, but to dependency relation as well, and also, to class attributes. A stereotype represents an extensibility mechanism that is foreseen in UML. It allows for the possibility to create new domain specific kinds of elements that are derived from the existing standard ones. In the simplest form, they act as annotations on the UML building blocks, but can redefine entirely the visual representation of the UML element. For example some elements may be considered, optional, recommended or required in the context of information exchange. This is possible by creating the three stereotypes and applying them accordingly [uml-userguide]. Much has been discussed about what an ontology is and is not [guarino2009ontology]. In computational context, an ontology encompasses a representation, formal naming and definition of the categories, properties and relations between the concepts, data and entities that substantiate one, many or all domains of discourse. Here we adopt the definition from [studer1998] that ``an ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization''. In this specification we adopt Web Ontology Language (OWL 2)[owl2] to specify the formal ontologies. OWL 2 is a knowledge representation language, with formally defined meaning, designed to formulate, exchange and reason with knowledge about a domain of interest. OWL 2 ontologies can be used along with information written in Resource Description Framework (RDF) [rdf11]. RDF is a standard model for data interchange on the Web. And OWL 2 ontologies themselves are primarily exchanged as RDF documents. An RDF document is composed of RDF statements. The RDF statement, or triple, is a three-slotted structure of the form \\(\\). The RDF statement asserts that some relationship, indicated by the predicate, holds between the resources denoted by the subject and object [rdf11]. The subject is always a resource identified by an URI, while the object may be either a URI resource or a literal value. Next, the relevant OWL 2 concepts are introduced. Classes provide an abstraction mechanism for grouping resources with similar characteristics. Classes can be understood as sets of individuals, called the class extension. The individuals in the class extension are called the instances of the class [owl1]. Individuals in OWL 2 represent actual objects from the domain. There can be named individuals, which are given an explicit name to refer to the same object; and anonymous individuals, which do not have an explicit name and are used locally. Datatypes are entities that refer to sets of data values. Thus, datatypes are analogous to classes, the main difference being that the former contain data values such as strings and numbers, rather than individuals [owl2]. Literals represent data values such as particular strings or integers. They can also be understood as individuals denoting data values. Literals can be either plain (no datatype) or typed [owl2]. In OWL 2 properties are defined as that which can take the predicate role in an RDF statement, and are distinguished as object properties and data properties. Object properties represent relationships between pairs of individuals. Data properties represent relationships between an individual and a literal. In some knowledge representation systems, functional data properties are called attributes [owl2].","title":"","component":"ROOT","version":"public-review","name":"definitions","url":"/public-review/uml/definitions.html","titles":[{"text":"Preliminary definitions","hash":"sec:definitions","id":1},{"text":"Conceptual Model","hash":"sec:cm","id":2},{"text":"Unified Modelling Language (UML)","hash":"sec:uml","id":3},{"text":"Formal ontology","hash":"sec:ontology","id":4}]},"26":{"id":26,"text":"The current set of UML Model Conventions are meant to guide the semantic engineers and ontolgy editors on producing consistent, uniform and uniquely interpretable conceptual models.
